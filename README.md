- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechWritingFitz
- 👀 I’m interested in Technical Writing, full-stack coding (Python, Flask and React in particular), and how these relate to helping people learn and become better at their jobs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, to which I can contribute.
- 📫 How to reach me: on GitHub, or thepitchprofessional@gmail.com
